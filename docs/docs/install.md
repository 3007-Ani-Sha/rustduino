## Application Setup

Weâ€™ll start by creating a new application with cargo, and setting it to use
nightly Rust.

```rust
$ cargo new --bin teensy
$ cd teensy
$ rustup override set nightly
```

We will need the `rust-src` crate for several functions. Now move over to
[Compiling and Linking](arduino/index.md)

```rust
$ rustup +nightly component add rust-src
```
