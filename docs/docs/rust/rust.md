Rust is a programming language designed for performance, safety, and especially safe concurrency.
Rust is statically and strongly typed systems programming language.
The biggest difference between Rust and other programming languages like C/C++ is that Rust offers safety by default.
High-level ergonomics and low-level control (such as memory usage) are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict.

Rust has been voted the most loved programming language in the [Stackoverflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020) every year since 2016.

Here is a simple “Hello, world” program in Rust.

```Rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world");
}
```
